## 📘 Project Overview

This project explores three approaches to image classification using the **Intel Image Dataset**:

1. **Custom CNN** — A convolutional neural network built from scratch and tuned through systematic hyperparameter exploration.  
2. **Transfer Learning** — Fine-tuning pretrained backbones such as **ResNet**, **EfficientNet**, and **MobileNet** to leverage prior feature learning.  
3. **Model Ensembling** — Combining multiple trained models using **soft**, **hard**, and **weighted voting** strategies to enhance accuracy and class-wise stability.

The notebook runs fully end-to-end, including training curves, confusion matrices, and performance analysis.  
**Results show that ensemble models consistently outperform individual CNNs**, demonstrating that architectural and hyperparameter diversity improve **robustness** and **generalization**.
